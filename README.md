# Currency Conversion Extension

## Description

This is a simple extension where you enter the currency you have and the currency you want to convert it to, and it outputs the converted amount. This is the first extension I have made, so any feedback would be appreciated. I wanted to do this project because my girlfriend is in Europe, and I often find myself needing to convert currencies that I don't know. And so I figured I could create my own solution.

## Installation

1. Download the latest release
2. Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a directory of your choice.
3. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
4. Enable "Developer mode" by toggling the switch in the top right corner.
5. Click on the "Load unpacked" button.
6. Select the directory where you extracted the ZIP file.
7. The extension should now appear in your list of installed extensions.
